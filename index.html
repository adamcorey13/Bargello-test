        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>Bargello is a 5★ Thief, who can be overclassed to a 6★. He can function as a DPS, shield breaker, or buffer/debuffer.
            As a DPS, he excels in doing single target damage, and he can increase the damage cap
            of your entire party simply by being a part of it. He can also restore SP and ultimate
            uses, and his A4 accessory boosts the damage cap of the holder even further!

        <h3>Should you pull for Bargello?</h3>
        <p>Bargello is a great addition to any team, even in today's current meta. His A4 is a great
            accessory for any DPS you might want to use since it boosts their damage cap by 100k
            and regenerates SP for the party.
